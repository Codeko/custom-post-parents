== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see one post type in the configuration screem =

The post type must be a hierarchical post type to be used by the plugin.

= What about the post type slug =

The posts that uses the Custom Post Parent plugin can't have a post type slug. This is because a url can have multiple post types, so no correct post type slug can be used.
